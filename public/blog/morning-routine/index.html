    <h1>Morning Routine to Be Productive and Win the Day</h1>
    <p>by Ben Pages on May 14, 2019</p>
    <p>The way you spend the first 60 minutes of your day can have a dramatic impact on the unfolding of the remaining 23 hours. Having a well-established routine is a key differentiator between people who react to and those who design life.</p>
<p>If morning routines are a new concept to you, I will guess with 99% confidence that this morning, you grabbed your phone before you even had eaten breakfast. You probably checked your messages, caught up on the news, and/or checked in to see what your friends had been up to on social media... Fair assumption?</p>
<p>The best morning routines are about intentionally preparing your body and mind for the day ahead. They're about protecting your focus and feeding your brain with empowering emotions that will ripple throughout the day.</p>
<p>Over the years, I've experimented with different morning routines from high-profile celebrities like Tony Robbins, Tim Ferriss, and Will Smith. Consequently, I noticed there are 7 elements that make up the morning routines of successful people.</p>
<p>I've compiled those 7 elements into one sample morning routine checklist. The order in which you tackle each item is not important. The order outlined below has been the most practical for me personally, but feel free to experiment and come up with your own sequence.</p>
<p>If you're looking to maximize your gains of energy and brainpower, include as many of these as possible into your own routine.</p>
<p>Try out these 7-morning routine rituals for 9 consecutive days to get a full experience of the energetic and mental benefits.</p>
<h2>1. Get Up</h2>
<p>As soon as your alarm rings, literally, SNAP OUT of bed.</p>
<p>Abruptness is key here. You need to get on your feet before your thoughts start kicking in and you manage to reason yourself out of waking up.</p>
<p>Practicing exploding out of bed regardless of circumstances is a powerful practice to get your day started; yet, much easier said than done.</p>
<p>Luckily, there is a simple technique you can use every day to never have to press the snooze button again. In an<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Lz0VOltZKA&amp;t=88s"> episode of Impact Theory</a>, Mel Robbins explains how using a mental 5-second countdown has transformed her life and productivity. This simple brain hack short-circuits the mind so that distracting thoughts such as &quot;why don't I bury my head under the pillow for another 15 minutes?&quot; never get a chance to emerge.</p>
<h2>2. Make Your Bed</h2>
<p>Big achievements are preceded by humbler ones. That's the idea behind the concept of momentum. Start small, finish big.</p>
<p>We want to achieve a small victory each day as early in the morning as possible in order to build up momentum towards the bigger and more ambitious goals that await us later on. That's why we'll start each morning with the satisfaction of a well-made bed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6OoCaGsz94">Check out this commencement speech</a> by Admiral William McRaven.</p>
<h2>3. Move</h2>
<p>Working out in the morning is an enormous habit to adopt. We all know it's good for us and we praise the well-accomplished early birds that welcome the sun in their sneakers. Yet, we can't seem to ever find the motivation or discipline to get started ourselves.</p>
<p>Maybe, we're just trying to take a bite that's larger than our mouths... Let's ponder for a second. What would working out in the morning look like if it were easy?</p>
<p>For the longest time, I couldn't get myself to exercise in the morning. My mattress always seemed too damn cozy... You know?</p>
<p>Then I heard an interview with<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Mullenweg"> Matt Mullenweg</a> on the Tim Ferriss show that caught my attention. When asked how he got in shape, Matt answered that he simply committed to one pushup a day.</p>
<p>While the mere idea of a 20-minute run or a 30-minute strength training at 7 AM might make most of us nauseous, a single pushup a day is something we can all afford the time and effort to complete, no matter how busy, lazy or out of shape we are!</p>
<p>So pick a number between 1 and 10 of reps you'd be willing to complete every day. Stick to that number; and, each day pick an interesting bodyweight or weighted exercise you can do in your room. Here are a few basic all-encompassing examples you can pick and choose from:</p>
<p>(easy, low intensity)</p>
<ul>
<li>pushups</li>
<li>squats</li>
<li>crunches</li>
</ul>
<p>(for more intensity)</p>
<ul>
<li>pike/handstand pushups</li>
<li>burpees</li>
<li>mountain climbers</li>
</ul>
<p>(weighted)</p>
<ul>
<li>kettlebell swings</li>
<li>weighted squats to shoulder press</li>
<li>weighted Russian twists</li>
</ul>
<p>Just 10, then you're done! DO NOT allow yourself to cross your bedroom door without first having completed this step.</p>
<h2>4. Hydrate</h2>
<p>During the night, we lose a lot of water through sweat and breathing. This water contains lots of minerals that are essential to the proper functioning of our bodies. Therefore, as part of our morning routine, we're going to chug a simple concoction that will take care of replenishing our blood, brain, and organs.</p>
<p>In a mason jar or large glass, stir together:</p>
<ul>
<li>1-2 pinches of sea- or Himalayan salt (contains over 60 key minerals)</li>
<li>1 tsp of organic apple cider vinegar (engages the digestive tract, prepares for breakfast)</li>
<li>1/2-1 fresh squeezed lemon (strengthens the immune system)</li>
<li>0.5-1L (15-30 oz) filtered water (for hydration, duh!)</li>
</ul>
<h2>5. Journal</h2>
<p>While drinking the morning cocktail, we're going to answer two questions in a few bullet points on paper. This short exercise trains our brain to focus on positive things, which in turn is likely to help us become better at spotting opportunities and grow a sense of appreciation throughout the day.</p>
<p>You can do this exercise in your journal or on a loose sheet of paper. Whether you decide to keep it or not doesn't matter; the important thing is to go through the thinking process and write down the answer so they become tangible.</p>
<p>1. What are three things I am grateful for?</p>
<p>Answers could be things, people, moments, etc. It could be as simple as a light breeze or the sound of singing birds.</p>
<ul>
<li>I am grateful to know my parents are in great health.</li>
<li>I am grateful I got to see the Great Wall of China, one of the seven wonders of this world.</li>
<li>I am grateful I can afford this delicious and warm cup of coffee from Starbucks.</li>
</ul>
<p>2. What are three things that would make today great?</p>
<p>Those could be events, encounters, achievements, coincidences, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li>Today would be a great day if I landed a new client for my business.</li>
<li>Today would be a great day if I went to the gym</li>
<li>Today would be a great day if I talked to a friend I haven't heard from in a few months</li>
</ul>
<h2>6. Breathe</h2>
<p>Breathing is probably the most undervalued source of energy we have access to. A few minutes of intentional breathing will purge the majority of toxins that have accumulated in our bodies.</p>
<p>For this exercise, we will do 3 sets of 30 explosive breaths through the nose. As we inhale, we'll shoot our arms up with our palms wide open. Then, on the exhale, we'll bring our elbows down to our ribcage while simultaneously closing our fists. We'll push the air out in one burst, starting all the way down from the gut up all the way through the nostrils. Someone sitting in a room adjacent should be able to hear us as we're doing this.</p>
<p>To get started, sit up straight in a comfortable chair and close your eyes. Between each set, rest for 20-30 seconds with your hands resting on your knees palms up, and relax. Focus on the sensations happening in your body. You might feel a slight tingle arise in various parts of your body or you might even notice inexplicable laughter creeping up. Just observe it and let it happen naturally.</p>
<p>After you've completed 3 sets of 30, gently get out of the chair and stretch.</p>

<h2>7. Cold Plunge</h2>
<p>Cold has been the greatest source of health in my life, and if I had to choose only one habit to keep for the rest of my life, it would be cold showers, hands down.</p>
<p>There is no particular right way to do cold therapy in my opinion. Some people, for example, recommend a contrasting approach where one would cycle a few minutes of warm showering with 30-60 seconds of cold water exposure. Some like to start hot, finish cold, others the other way around. And finally, some would rather go full-blown cold. It's up to preference.</p>
<p>Here are a few tips for beginners:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remain fully immersed in cold water for at least 30 seconds at a time. You can use a timer in the beginning.</li>
<li>Breathe! You might have trouble breathing on your first attempt. This is normal. Relax, try to take fewer deeper breaths, hold on to a steady object, and remove yourself from the water if you get light-headed.</li>
<li>Prior to starting the cold water, already have the showerhead above your body. That way, you remove the possibility of hesitance and possibly not following through (no tip-toeing).</li>
</ul>
<p>And that's it! After coming out of the shower, get dressed, eat a healthy breakfast and get going with your day as usual. Now is a good time to check the news, email and social media.</p>
<p>** IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER** I am not a doctor, and what's working for me might not necessarily be good for you. Therefore, I strongly advise you to seek medical advice before attempting any kind of cold exposure. Shallow water blackouts can be deadly.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Mornings are the tipping points that set our lives in motion. Morning routine rituals are the levers that give us the ability to drive that motion in the direction of our goals.</p>
<p>If you want to regain some control over life, whether it is to beat anxiety, lose weight or simply be happier, you need a solid step-by-step morning routine that activates your brain and energizes your entire body.</p>
<p>It doesn't have to be complicated - it just has to exist. A morning routine is a mere 30 minutes that you can crush daily. It is something that you can look back on and be proud of at the end of the day, no matter how chaotic and turbulent the remaining 23.5 hours might have turned out.</p>
