  <h1>7 Habits of High Achievers to Conquer</h1>
  <p>by Ben Pages</p>
  <ol>
<li>They Have a Routine</li>
</ol>
<p>No matter how simple it is, a consistent routine results in self-discipline. Why would you want to be more disciplined? Self-discipline is the fuel that drives you forward. You see, many of us let our moods and behaviors affect what we do and don't do. Self-discipline is saying no to an invitation to hang out with your friends, it's sitting down and doing the work even when there's some interesting to watch on Netflix, it's doing away with excuses and focusing on the one thing that matters—the work. A routine is where it starts.</p>
<p>Soon, you'll also find that besides cultivating self-discipline, routines create a pleasant sense of certainty. On an unpredictable and temptuous day, your routine is your anchor, the one familiar thing you can count on in the midst of chaos.</p>
<p>A routine is something that you commit to doing every single day, no matter what. Here are a few common examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tidy up the bed first thing in the morning</li>
<li>Meditate upon waking</li>
<li>Workout during the day</li>
<li>Kiss your kids good night</li>
<li>Journal before bed</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>They Ignore What People Think of Them</li>
</ol>
<p>To experience unusual results, you've got to be willing to do unusual things. This makes us stand out. While most of us are ok being weird at home, alone., it becomes a lot harder to stick to our guns whe people start questioning us.</p>
<p>We live in a world where everyone's got an opinion. And they want to make damn sure we know about it. When 'should's' come swinging at them, high performers know to keep their eyes on the ball and keep swimming against the current despite what anybody else might say about it.</p>
<p>Someone giving advice is someone that wishes to be right. So in order to gently push unsolicited advice out of your way, simply let the other person know they are right and make them feel significant for sharing their opinion.</p>
<p>&quot;You're right, I can see how this approach beats any others. I might regret this later, but I'm going to try it differently this time, just for the sake of learning. I appreciate you having my back!&quot;</p>
<p>Instead of arguing your point of view, we use this as an opportunity to make someone feel great and strengthen your bond with them.</p>
<p>Stealth mission: next time you're given advice, acknowledge it and let is go. Do not argue it, do not follow it.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>They've Mastered the Art of Saying No</li>
</ol>
<p>The human mind loves distractions. Distractions are appealing and unfortunately for us, they're all around. Sounds, notifications, invitations, conversations, you name it.</p>
<p>Staying focused takes more than willpower. It also takes courage—the courage of saying no.</p>
<p>High performers understand that time spent on one thing is time taken away from another. And since we're all competing with the same 24 hours, the choice of what we do with each one of them is detrimental in how far we can go.</p>
<p>To cultivate that in your own life, practice rejecting invitations with a gentle &quot;thanks, and no&quot;. Notice the use of &quot;and&quot; here which is key. Most of us would instinctively want to use &quot;but&quot;. However, in linguistics, &quot;but&quot; is used to negate whatever content precedes it in a sentence. So when you say &quot;thanks, but no&quot;, it's almost like you're cancelling the gratitude part of your statement.</p>
<p>&quot;Thanks, and no&quot; lets you fully acknowledge the other person's generosity.</p>
<p>Stop there. No need to explain. Explanations lead to counter-arguments and debates. A simple no should be all the person really needs to live on.</p>
<p>Rejecting something often feels like we're rejecting the person bringing that thing to our attention (eg. a person making a gift, a friend suggesting to go on a trip, a coworker inviting us out for drinks). And that's often why saying no feels so hard. We're scared that if we say no, we'll lose the connection we have with whomever is extending us their generosity.</p>
<p>Stealth mission: over the course of a day, purposefully reject any invitation presented to you. Can you join the meeting? Thanks for inviting me, and no. Want to go for beers after work? I'm glad you thought of me, and not this time. You get the jist.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>They Know What They Want</li>
</ol>
<p>Getting what you want starts with knowing what you want. Through coaching dozens of individuals, I realized that one of the most common reasons people are stuck is because they know what they don't want, but not what they actually do want.</p>
<p>If you want a quick way to shift your whole life, remove negative statements out of your communication. Let's dive into a few examples:</p>
<p>I wish he'd stop talking to me that way!
I don't want to be nervous in front of my students.
I don't want to be stuck in an office my whole life.</p>
<p>Every time you catch yourself &quot;not wanting&quot; something, ask yourself what you'd want instead.</p>
<p>I wish he'd stop talking to me that way!
-&gt; How would you want him to talk to you instead?
--&gt; I want him to talk to me with compassion and respect.</p>
<p>I don't want to be nervous in front of my students.
-&gt; How do you want to feel instead?
--&gt; I want to be confident and free to be myself!</p>
<p>I don't want to be stuck in an office my whole life.
-&gt; Where do you want to work instead?
--&gt; I want to work remotely so I can travel the world!</p>
<p>Stealth mission: choose 3 areas of your life where you feel dissatisfied and write down a goal for each of them. Make sure they're expressing what you want, not what you <em>don't</em> want.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>They Start with the End Game in Mind</li>
</ol>
<p>Specific over Vague</p>
<p>Proactive over Reactive</p>
<p>Think Before you Do</p>
<p>Do Before You Feel</p>
<p>Proactive</p>
<p>Motivated by vs away</p>
<p>Start with the end game</p>
<p>Start small</p>
<p>Minimize risk (strucuting a worst case scenario that's benefitial)</p>
<p>Be then Do (cf Terry Crews on TF podcast)</p>
<p>Keep going (understanding the journey is already underway)</p>
<p>Listen, don't follow others</p>
<p>Clarity</p>
<p>Energy</p>
<p>They know their values</p>
<p>Work with others / Have a team</p>
<p>Act before being confident</p>
<p>Understand your why</p>
<p>Do Things for themselves, not others, not afraid to be disliked</p>
<p>Speak in the positive</p>
<p>Self-discipling</p>
<p>Faith</p>
