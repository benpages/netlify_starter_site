  <h1>About</h1>

  <h2>Hello, friend! My name's Ben.</h2>
  <p>I struggle with digital wellness <em>every damn day</em>.</p>
  <p>I love tech. I love using it and learning about it—crypto, AI, programming, digital marketing... I love it all!.</p>
  <p>But I don't know if tech loves me back because sometimes, it hurst me—like physically hurts me.</p>
  <p>Because friends, when I lose myself in the world of email and social media for too long, I get rashes. My skin literally starts dying because of FOMO and hyperconnectivity.</p>
  <p>It's a blessing and a curse, because that's how I know I've been sucked in and it's time for a reset.</p>
  <p>What I try and learn, I put on this blog.</p>
  <h2>So what if I didn't?</h2>
  <p>The name of this blog comes from one of my favorite self-reflection questions of all time: what would happen if I didn't?</p>
  <p>This questions has led me to try the experiments you'll read about on this blog.</p>
  <p>Like: "What would I <em>really</em> miss out on if I didn't use my phone for a month?". Or: "What would happen if I took a month off from work and didn't check my inbox even once?"</p>
  <h2>Digital detoxification and mindful living</h2>

  <p>
    In the archives, you'll find tips, hacks, and habits that'll help you regain control of your attention, set digital boundaries, get rid of digital FOMO, reconnect with yourself, create authentic relationships, and maximize your God-given potential.</p>
