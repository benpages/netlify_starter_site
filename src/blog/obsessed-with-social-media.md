Disclaimer: This is not medical advice. If you feel like you might be developing a social media addiction, talk to a therapist. But if you're looking for tips on how to cut down the time you spend on social media, read on.

You can‚Äôt count on being rational in times when you feel the need to pick up your phone. Your brain will come up with plenty of reasons why now is a good time to look at your phone. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to be late for the meeting. Better check directions to make sure I‚Äôm on the best route.‚Äù ‚ÄúShe‚Äôll think I‚Äôm ghosting her if I don‚Äôt respond; I‚Äôve got to do it now.‚Äù

<h2 id="find-your-why">1. Use the 5 Why's technique</h2>

For many of us, social media is an escape. Some browse social media because their life isn't very exciting. Other because they don't want to deal with whatever problem life has thrown at them that day.

For instance, I browse social media when I feel lonely. Seeing what my friends across the world are up to makes me feel a little more connected to them.

If you can bring awareness to whatever's missing in your life that causes you to browse social media obsessively, you can fill that void and get rid of your social media obsession.

To find out what you're escaping from with social media, use the 5 Why's techique. Ask yourself "Why" at least 5 times in a row to get to the root of your discomfort.

Here's an example..

**Why do I browse social media?**<br>
‚úçÔ∏è To see what my friends are up to.

**Why care about what my friends are up to?**</br>
‚úçÔ∏è Because I want to stay close to them.

**Why try to stay close to them?**<br/>
‚úçÔ∏è Because they live far away and we don't see each other often.

**Why do I feel the need to see them often?**<br/>
‚úçÔ∏è Because I'm afraid they'll forget me.

**Why is it important they don't forget me?**<br/>
‚úçÔ∏è I don't want to be alone.

Once you discover what causes you to seek distraction, you can do something about it. The right thing to do for me in the example above would be to go out and meet people.

Social media helps you avoid problems, not deal with them. Once you deal with your problems, there will be nothing left to avoid; social media won't seem as appealing as it used to be.

<h2 id="practice-being-unplugged">2. Practice being unplugged</h2>

Introduce no-social-media times in your schedule to rediscover what it's like to be unplugged and undisturbed.

For example:

- Go for walks without your phone
- Disconnect cellular data when you‚Äôre commuting
- Use a [dumb phone]("https://whatifididnt.com/blog/iphone-dumb-phone/") on the weekends
- Leave your phone in a different room at night (or when you‚Äôre going to the toilet)

These small practices will help you reduce your time on social media and slowly build your discipline back up.

You‚Äôre more likely to stick with a habit when you do it right before or after something you already do casually, like brushing your teeth or taking the bus. So find one or two things you do daily, like making coffee or getting into bed, and get into the habit of stashing your phone away right before or after them.

_"I will put my phone on airplane mode every evening right before I brush my teeth. I will turn off airplane mode after my brush my teeth the next morning."_

<h2 id="limit-social-media-use-to-desktop">3. Limit social media use to Desktop</h2>

Delete social media apps from your phone and only access social media through your laptop, in a browser.

This strategy has two benefits:

**1. Social media websites aren't nearly as enjoyable (addictive) on desktop as they are on mobile**

Take Instagram. The user interface is slow and not always intuitive. The friction of using desktop apps makes it more likely you‚Äôll want to stay on them for very long. Yet, you can do everything from the browser that you can do from your phone, including checking your notifications, posting content, and reading and replying to messages.

**2. You don‚Äôt always have your laptop with you**

Which means that, by default, you‚Äôre going to have less access to social media apps throughout the day. You won't be able to check Instagram when commuting, grocery shopping, or eating dinner.

If you _really_ need the app version of a social media platform for one reason or another, install it, do what you have to do, then delete it right away. It's annoying on purpose. The more friction to using an app, the less likely you are to open it mindlessly.

<h2 id="replace-social-media-with-other-activities">4. Fill your time intentionally</h2>

If you follow the strategies in this post and successfully reduce your obsession with social media, you'll have a lot of extra time on your hands.

And if you don't know how to use that time, you'll go right back to filling it with mindless browsing.

Say you spend four hours on social media and you manage to cut down your screen time by 1 hour. What are you going to do with the extra hour? It's super important you plan this in advance if you want healthy social media habits to stick.

Ideally, you'll spend it offline.

Make a list of 2 or things that you will do instead of browsing social media when you have extra time on your hands.

üïë Dust off my guitar chops<br>
üïë Reach out to potential clients for my side hustle<br>
üïë Complete DIY projects around the house<br>

Choose activities that are fun and motivate you. These shouldn't feel like things you "have to do" but something you "can't wait to do".

And make sure you can do them at a moment's notice. The less friction, the more likely it is you'll stick with them.

<h2 id="set-social-media-goals">Set weekly social media goals</h2>

Tracking social media use is an excellent way to not only be obsessed but also feel bad about it. That‚Äôs something we want to avoid. A healthier approach is to start the week with a particular intention for how you use social media. On Sunday night, grab a journal, and decide in advance how many hours you‚Äôd like to spend on social media maximum and what you‚Äôre hoping to get from it. ‚ÄúI will spend two hours on social media this week to hear the latest updates from my favorite artists, catch up with a few friends, and share a few updates of my own.‚Äù

At the end of the week, you can review your goal and compare it with your actual screen time. Then adjust your goal for the following week. But don‚Äôt beat yourself up. Habit tracking can be an obsession in and of itself and can cause more stress than good. The important part is to set goals to become more intentional in how you use social media. The goal you‚Äôll set on Sunday will be in the back of your mind throughout the week. You may achieve your goal or not; it doesn‚Äôt matter. The increased awareness is what we‚Äôre truly seeking.

<h2 id="configure-your-notifications">5. Customize your notifications</h2>

Removing notifications for social media apps can also be ineffective. If you‚Äôre obsessed with social media, notifications are feeding into your obsession and should be turned off. However, when you remove notifications, you may find yourself opening apps more often just to check if you missed something. And every time you open an app, you risk getting sucked in by the algorithm, realizing 30 minutes later that you‚Äôve been mindlessly scrolling when you just wanted to check if your friend had responded to your DM.

These strategies don‚Äôt work in the long run. Instead, choose what notifications matter to you and disable others. Do you really need a notification every time somebody likes a post you made? Visit your app‚Äôs settings and disable all the notifications you don‚Äôt need. For example, on Instagram, go to Settings then Push Notifications.

Lastly, spend time offline doing activities that make you feel alive, such as walking a dog in nature. You should strive to feel stimulated rather than bored.

<h2 id="social-media-blockers">Are social media blockers effective?</h2>

One might think that the key to overcoming social media obsession is to set hard boundaries. For instance, locking yourself out of social media apps after a certain amount of time or hiding their icons deep inside folders on your phone. However, these strategies grossly underestimate the power of your obsession.

The thing with obsession is that it‚Äôs hard to control, especially when it is triggered. I don‚Äôt believe that using apps like Freedom or Focus to limit social media activity is effective. If you really want to, you know how to bypass these apps, and you will. And when you do bypass them, you'll feel like you don‚Äôt have discipline, beating yourself up and making you miserable. This will likely make you want to escape to the digital world even more, creating a self-fulfilling cycle.

To set yourself up for success, you should focus on positive reinforcement rather than punishment. Habits are forged through positive reinforcement, so reward yourself for a good week with little social media. However, don‚Äôt beat yourself up if you find yourself spending more time on social media than you‚Äôd planned.

Every time you pick up your phone, you enter a battle, with companies making your phone and the apps that are on it, professional at manipulating your attention. Trying to defeat them with good old willpower is nothing but a slippery slope. Therefore, give yourself some slack and focus on enriching your life offline.
