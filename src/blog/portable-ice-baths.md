<strong>⚠️ None of this is medical advice.</strong> Always consult your doctor before using an ice bath if you have health issues. Children and vulnerable adults should never use ice baths unsupervised. Ice baths can lower body temperature, constrict blood vessels, and may raise the risk of cardiac arrest or stroke.
</small>

<h2 id="considerations">Considerations</h2>

### Size

You want to get an ice tub in which you can sit comfortably and submerge your body up to your neck.

Most ice baths can accomodate people up to 6 feet 7 inches (2 meters tall) and 300 pounds. This number can vary slightly based on the brand. "Max. suitable height" is a standard spec that you will find listed on the manufacturer's website.

Some brands offer XL versions of their tubs. Coldpod, for example, recently release the Ice Pod XL that adds an additional 31.7 gal. (120 L) to their original ice bath.

<img class="img-fw" src="/assets/blog/portable-ice-bath-size.jpg" alt="">

### Cooling mechanism

Ice baths can be cooled in one of two ways: with ice or via a chiller that automatically keeps the water at a set temperature. Most portable ice baths use the former. You fill them up with cold water and use ice to bring it to your desired temperature.

One expection is the Ice Pod, by the ThePodCompany which can be cooled either way. The company produces a chiller that you can buy in addition to the tub for $999.

The upside of chillers is that you don't need ice and most can also be used to warm up the water instead of cooling it. However, chillers are expensive, bulky, and require an electrical plug.

### Portability

Portable ice baths are inflatable and can be folded for easy transport. However, there are some exceptions, like the Ice Barrel 400, which is made of hard recycled plastic. At 55 lbs, it can still be transported and set up just about anywhere, but with more hassle than other models on our list which weigh under 8 lbs.

### UV resistance

If you’re going to leave your ice bath outside, you’ll want to make sure it doesn’t get damaged by the sun.
UV rays can cause materials to deteriorate, fade, and become brittle. Therefore, UV protection will help you increase the durability of your ice bath.

### Insulation

Every portable ice bath uses different insulation technology to keep the water as cool as possible.
The better the insulation, the less often you’ll have to refill with ice.

<img class="img-fw" src="/assets/blog/portable-ice-bath-insulation.jpg" alt="">

### Drain valve

A drain is an important element that every ice bath should have. It allows you to quickly drain the water from the tub when you need to.
Without a drain, you’ll have to empty out the tub a bucket of water at a time or you’ll have to invest in a submersible pump.

<h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2>

<h3 id="how-much-water">How much water do I need?</h3>

You want to fill up your ice bath so that you can immerse yourself up to your shoulders without the water overflowing.

Figuring the exact amount you need will require trial and error.

As a rule of thumb, you’ll never want to fill up the ice bath more than two-thirds of the way. The water will rise once you jump in and add in the ice.

If you’re concerned with the tub overflowing, start with 50% water, then slowly add more water until you reach the optimal level. So if the capacity of your ice bath is 400 L, start with 200 L and go from there.

<h3 id="how-much-ice">How much ice to use?</h3>

This depends on:

- how cold you want the bath to be
- what temperature the water is at before you put in the ice
- how much water you have in the tub (the less water you use, the less ice you’ll need to cool it down)

Through trial and error, you’ll find out what quantity of ice is ideal for your specific model and set up.

Ice Pod recommends adding anywhere between 15 and 40 lbs of ice (7-18kg) to the tub per session. So start with 15 lbs (7 kg), let the water cool down, measure the temperature, and add more ice if needed.

<h3 id="how-long">How long should you stay in an ice bath?</h3>

Stay in the ice bath for 2-3 minutes.

When you first get in the ice bath, you’ll tense up and hyperventilate. Slow down your breathing and relax.

After a while, you’ll feel a sense of calm and peace. That’s the state we’re looking for. Once you’ve reached it, you can end your session.

<h3 id="temperature">What temperature is recommended?</h3>

Getting used to ice baths can take some getting used to.

Start with 59° F (15°C) and progressively decrease the temperature session after session.

You may also want to practice taking cold showers to get used to the shock the cold creates on your body.

<img class="img-fw" src="/assets/blog/portable-ice-bath-accessories.jpg" alt="">

<h3 id="change-water">How often do you change the water?</h3>

Replace the water in your tub every 3 to 5 sessions and clean thoroughly before refilling.

If you want to change the water less often, add epsom salt to your bath (about 1 lb or 0.5kg per tub). This will allow you to keep your water clean.

If you use salt, you can replace the water every 2 to 4 weeks. Do not use table salt or other types of chloride salts.

<h3 id="clean">How do I clean and maintain an ice bath?</h3>

Before you use your ice bath for the first time, make sure to properly wash it with soap and water.

Do not use bleach or other chemical products - they may damage your tub’s isolating and waterproofing properties.

<h3 id="where-set-up">Where should I set up my portable ice bath?</h3>

Most portable ice baths are UV resistant so you can use them outside as well as inside.

Check your ice bath’s instruction manual for “maximum temperatures”.

The LUMI Recovery Pod can sustain temperatures of up to 50C, for example. So you might not want to leave it in the sun for too long.

**For those of you wanting to set it up on your balcony:**

Once filled up, your ice bath will weigh over 300 kg. Add your body weight, and that’s a lot of weight in a small area.

Your balcony may not be built to sustain such pressure.

Consult your developer, builder, Homeowners Association (HOA), Condominium Board, or a structural engineer before it is safe to set up a portable ice bath on your balcony.

<h3 id="after-eating">Is it safe to take an ice bath after eating?</h3>

Ice baths are safe after eating. Cold water does not drive blood flow away from your core organs, and thus does not interfere with digestion.

I’m not a doctor, and you may want to confirm this with a medical professional before jumping in right after a gluttony.

<img class="img-fw" src="/assets/blog/ice-bath-landscape.jpg" alt="">

<h2 id="benefits">Benefits of Ice Baths: Real or Made Up?</h2>

Despite what you might read online, there is a lack of evidence supporting claims that cold water immersion has positive impacts on sleep, workout recovery, mood, weight loss, or immunity.

Just check out some of these studies:

- "Cold water immersion is no more effective than active recovery for minimizing the inflammatory and stress responses in muscle after resistance exercise" ([J Physiol, 2017](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5285720/))
- "The results suggest no relevant effects of 3-week repeated [cold water immersion] on leukocyte counts in healthy men." ([Frontiers in Physiology, 2023](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/373544807_Effects_of_3-week_repeated_cold_water_immersion_on_leukocyte_counts_and_cardiovascular_factors_an_exploratory_study))
- "Current evidence suggests CWI has either nil or detrimental effects on physiological adaptations to resistance training" ([Front Sports Act Living, 2021](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8060572/))

All the peer-reviewed studies that I’ve found all conclude the same way, using statements like “there is still a lack of evidence”, or “results are unclear”, or “further studies with larger sample sizes are needed.”

Now, if you’ve ever taken an ice bath or a cold shower, you know that you feel amazing afterwards. And that, for me, is enough to continue practicing cold water exposure year after year.
