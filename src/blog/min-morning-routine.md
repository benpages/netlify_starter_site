<h2 id="what-is-a-minimalist-morning-routine">What is a <em>minimalist</em> morning routine?</h2>

What makes a morning routine minimalist? It is its ability to prepare you to live the day ahead with intention and clarity.

A great minimalist morning routine should prepare you to make choices that will bring joy and create possibility in your day. It's a routine that will ground you in your values and will help you distinguish signal from noise throughout the day.

Down below, you'll discover 10 rituals that make up a morning routine. Pick and choose what works for you.

As a minimalist, I encourage you to experiment with each individual habit and ask: "Does this bring me value? Does this bring me joy?". If the answer is no, eliminate it.

<h3 id="scrape-your-tongue-and-brush-your-teeth">Scrape your tongue and brush your teeth</h3>

Start you day with oral care. Yes, <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/should-you-brush-your-teeth-before-or-after-breakfast">before breakfast</a>. Doing so will protect your enamel and prevent bacteria accumulated on your teeth and tongue to fall back into your digestive tract.

Use a tongue scraper to remove bacteria from your tongue, then brush your teeth. You an also pull with coconut oil while you proceed with the rest of your routine.

Worried about bad breath? Flossing and flushing your mouth with water or a fluroide solution after breakfast will help get rid of food residue between your teeth and keep a clean mouth.

<img class="img-fw" src="/assets/blog/morning-routine-oral-care.jpg" alt="a toothbrush during a minimalist morning routine">

<h3 id="drink-a-large-glass-of-water">Drink a large glass of water</h3>

Your body sheds water at night through sweating and breathing.

Drinking a large glass of water (2 to 4 glasses) on an empty stomach will jump start your metabolism, strengthen your immune system, and help proper cell and brain function.

You can also add electrolytes and vitamins to your water.

My favorite morning cocktail has a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar and a pinch of himalayan sea salt in it. Sometimes, I'll throw in a bit of honey, ginger, and turmeric as well and drink it warm.

<h3 id="make-your-bed">Make Your Bed</h3>

Making your bed is a simple yet effective way to prime your brain for achievement. It's going to give you a small dose of dopamine. Its effects are going to ripple throughout your day.

If you work from home, you'll also be giving your mind a tidy and organized environment to operate in.

Big achievements are often preceded by humbler ones. By making your bed, you're triggering the momentum that will lead you to conquer bigger tasks throughout the day.

And if your day doens't go well, you'll at least have the satisfaction of coming home to a bed well made.

<h3 id="move">Move</h3>

Energize your body and get your blood flowing with a bit of exercise.

We're not talking about a full-on workout‚Äîjust movement.

Depending on the amount of time you have and your level of fitness, consider the following options:

- **Stretching:** roll your head, shoulders and hips a few times in each direction
- **Yoga:** pull out your yoga mat and knock out a few poses. Keep it simple. Pop a downard facing dog, an upward facing dog, a child's pose, and a shoulder bridge, and a couple of warrior poses, for example.
- **Bodyweight exercises:** a dozen of jump and jacks, squats, pushups, crunches or burpees should do the trick.
- **Cardio:** if you have the time, go out for a brisk walk, a jog, or go up and down the staircase a few times.

<h3 id="get-direct-sunlight">Get direct sunlight</h3>

Ever heard of the circadian rhythm? It's your body's clock. And it's regulated in big part by light.

In other words, your body knows whether to be awake or sleep based on how much light hits your eye.

Exposing yourself to enough light in the morning is going trigger the release of cortisol in your body and help you feel energized rather than sleepy. It also helps you sleep better at the day's end.

If you feel like you can't start a day without coffee, it may very well be that you're not getting enough light early on in the day.

Direct daylight is the most powerful source of light you can get.

Light coming from a screen or through a window doesn't work as well, which is why you need to step outside, at least for a couple of minutes.

Do not wear sunglasses as these will block the light and prevent it from working its magic.

<div class="well">
<div class="container-sm">
<h4>üï∂Ô∏è Pro tip: Delay caffein intake</h4>
<p>The moment light hits your eye in the morning, your body starts releasing a hormone called cortisol. Cortisol helps your body be alert (read: awake). It is a natural source of energy.</p>
<p>Caffein interferes with the production of said cortisol, which can reduce its effects. Thus it is best to delay caffein intake to about  60 minutes after waking up.</p>

<h3 id="meditate">Meditate</h3>

As minimalists, we want to be able to make conscious decisions throughout the day and not react to negative or impulsive thoughts.

Meet meditation - a powerful way to quiet your mind and see through the negative thoughts that clutter our minds.

Meditation is a difficult practice. A guided practice like Sam Harriss' Waking Up course is a great way to get started.

If you haven't had much success with meditation, try breathing exercises instead. They have the similar - though not as profound - effect of grounding and pausing your stream of thoughts.

<h3 id="practice-gratitude">Practice gratitude</h3>

Gratitude is a powerful emotion. You can't be angry (or sad or anxious) and grateful at the same time.

A gratitude practice is an important ritual to include in your minimalist morning routine for it will clear negative thoughts and help you gain perspective on what matters in your life.

Moreover, if you believe in the law of attraction, you then know that focusing on what you're grateful for is likely to bring more of those things into your life.

<blockquote>"Happiness is not having what you want, but wanting what you have." - Rabbi Hyman Schachtel</blockquote>

Take 2 minutes each morning to give thanks for things you have‚Äîhealthy family members, a roof to sleep under, or access to potable water, for example.

To intensify the feeling, you can practice "negative visualization", a practice introduced by the stoics. Simplpy imagine what it's like to live without a bed, food, or someone you care about.

<h3 id="journal">Journal</h3>

Use journaling to offload mental clutter and capture your most creative thoughts.

There are two common ways to journal.

The first is to write down all of your thoughts on the page, as they come, until you reach a mental "inbox zero".

The second is to journal about a specific topic.

I like the second form. So did Thomas Edison, who said:

<blockquote>"Never go to sleep without a request to your subconscious."</blockquote>

The morning is the ideal time to resolve problems from the day before. In fact, during the night, your subconscious' been working to do that for you. Which is why "sleeping on an issue" is so effective.

Ask something of your subconscious the night before, like "should I take the job offer?". Then let it go. Do not think or try to solve it at night. Let it simmer overnight.

First thing when you wake up, pull out your journal and write down all the thoughts about the issue that come to mind.

<div class="well mb-3">
<div class="container-sm">
  <h4>üï∂Ô∏è Pro tip: Journal pre-input</h4>
  <p>Access your deepest, most creative thoughts pre-input. External stimuli like the news, the weather, or social media updates clutter your mind and make it difficult to retrieve ideas and concepts your subconscious distiled during the night.</p>
  <p>So journal as early as in the morning as possible. Before you turn on your phone. Before you turn on the TV. Before you talk to anyone.</p>

<img class="img-fw" src="/assets/blog/morning-routine-journaling.jpg" alt="a notebook that serves for the minimalist morning routine journaling">

<h3 id="set-intentions">Set intentions</h3>

Conclude your journal entry with your intentions for the day. Write down what you plan on accomplishing, but also how you plan on showing up as a person.

This is a great time to remind and keep yourself accountable for your values as a minimalist.

At the end of your day, you have the possibility to look back at your intentions and evaluate how well you've done. And if you fell short, use that insight to shape the next day's morning routine.

<h3 id="groom">Groom</h3>

Do you feel different when you go about your day looking sharp as a tack than when you run out the door wearing your "I woke up like this" look?

Grooming in the morning can help you feel more attractive and confident, and ultimately affect how you show up in your interactions with others.

Take some time in the morning to take care of yourself.

If you like to shower in the morning, try turning the shower knob all the way to cold for at least 30 seconds either at the beginning or end of your wash.

Cold exposure has been proven to improve mood, boost your immune system, and trains you to remain calm in situations of stress. This is a great way to practice keeping a cool head when external circumstances get tough.

Breathe deeply and resist the urge to step out of the stream.

<h2 id="why-is-a-morning-routine-important">Why is a morning routine important?</h2>

The way you spend the first 60 minutes of your day can have a dramatic impact on the unfolding of the remaining 23 hours. Having a well-established routine is a key differentiator between people who react to and those who design life.

If morning routines are a new concept to you, I will guess with 99% confidence that this morning, you grabbed your phone before you even had eaten breakfast. You probably checked your messages, caught up on the news, and/or checked in to see what your friends had been up to on social media... Fair assumption?

The best morning routines are about intentionally preparing your body and mind for the day ahead. They're about protecting your focus and feeding your brain with empowering emotions that will ripple throughout the day and empower you to embrace simple living.
