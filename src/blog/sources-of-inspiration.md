This blog post will introduce 10 sources of inspiration – from nature to art – that will inspire innovative thinking and get those creative juices flowing again.

If you're looking for ways to reignite your creative spark and come up with great ideas, you're in the right place.

Let's dive in.

## Go for a walk

An essential part of being creative is getting outside your head and moving your body. The simple act of walking forces your physiology to change and gets your blood flowing. Walking helps your focus expand, allowing new ideas to flow more freely. This can give you that spark of motivation or source of inspiration when you feel like you have lost it.

Take a simple walk without any destination. Enjoy a break from the daily grind and immerse yourself in the scene of your surroundings. Imagine yourself as a spectator, watching a play with its own characters, plots, and subplots.

You may find that even mundane scenes like a child stroking their doll or a clerk counting change can become sources of inspiration from this mindset.

## Read a book

Books are filled with original ideas which you use to spark your own. When we read, our attention moves away from our problems, and we become more resourceful.

Reading exposes us to new ways of thinking. It stimulates our imagination, introduces us to different perspectives, and expands our understanding of the world. It also provides a sense of relaxation and escape, which helps clear the mind and create space for creative thinking.

The exercise is the same whether you like to read fiction or non-fiction. Read a few pages until you find inspiration or feel ready to go back to work.

## Take yourself out on a date

Want to ignite your creative spark? Why not take yourself on a creative date!

Start by setting aside specific time for yourself, free from distractions. Next, decide on an activity that appeals to you – this can be anything from dining out to going to a concert.

Leave your phone in your pocket. Or, even better, turn your phone into a dumb phone for the day, so you're not tempted to distract yourself.

Don't worry if no inspiration comes from these dates at first. Keep trying different activities and observe how they affect your mood and productivity. Solo dates are fun! So even if inspiration doesn't strike, you'll enjoy a good time.

## Listen to music

Music can help us tap into sources of inspiration we might not have realized were there. It can evoke emotions and stimulate our senses in ways other forms of art cannot. It can be a powerful tool for accessing parts of ourselves that we may have forgotten about or ignored.

Listening to music can also act as a form of meditation. It relaxes us and opens up new perspectives on life.

Experiment with different genres and explore music from other cultures. I like to listen to binaural beats – often associated with meditation. But classical music and other instrumental tracks can also stimulate creative output.

## Visit an art gallery or museum

There is something so special about an art gallery or museum atmosphere. Surrounded by fine works of art, it is difficult not to feel moved and inspired.

Look at the paintings or sculptures from different angles. Observe the objects in detail and notice how they were created.

Allow the exhibition to take you on an emotional journey. Get lost in the ambiance and open to the sources of inspiration that abound.

Take your time. Sit with a single piece of art longer than it feels comfortable, and you'll start to notice subtleties you have not seen before. You may begin to understand some of the artist's decisions and the story they hoped to convey.

## Learn more about someone you consider successful

What about reading or watching the life story of someone you admire to find sources of inspiration?

Whether it's a famous figure, an entrepreneur, or someone closer to home, studying their journey and successes can help you develop creative ideas for your projects. By learning about how they achieved success, you may gain insight into strategies that could work for you too. You might also discover innovative solutions to problems holding back your progress. Understanding the struggles and challenges these successful figures faced can also keep us motivated when the going gets tough by reminding us what power resilience and perseverance hold.

Books are one of several ways you can learn about someone famous. But you can also watch a Netflix docuseries or TV drama or listen to a podcast interview. How I Built This, for example, has fantastic stories about how the most significant companies of our time were built, told by their founders.

## Travel to another city or country

Traveling offers the opportunity to explore new cultures, meet different people, and experience things you wouldn't usually get in your day-to-day life. Being in a new environment stimulates the mind.

You might find yourself inspired by the architecture and art of a new destination or perhaps by the beauty of nature, which you do not have access to at home. You could also discover exciting customs and traditions, which may open up ideas for creative projects back home.

The inspiration you get when traveling can fade quickly. And you might not feel as inspired once you get home. So I recommend you keep a journal while you travel to jot down thoughts, ideas, and feelings as they come up to capture the spark and keep it alive long after your trip ends.

## Call a creative friend

When I feel stuck, I call friends who I know are working on exciting projects. Listening to what they're up to is an excellent source of inspiration. By the time we hang up, I want to get off my chair and start getting work done.

Listening to someone else's story can inspire and motivate you to take action on your big dreams.

A good friend can also be a sounding board for discussing and developing new ideas. They might offer insights from their own experiences that may help you get unstuck.

Be mindful of who you choose to call. Some friends are more inspiring than others. Choose optimistic friends you consider highly creative and who are currently "in the trenches" - aka doing creative work. Talking to the wrong person may demotivate you even more.

## Journal

Journaling helps hash out thoughts. Thoughts come and go. But when you write them down, you can explore a single thought for longer and in greater depth. Journaling will help clarify your thoughts. It will make it easier to see patterns and connections you may not have noticed. You will come up with solutions and ideas you hadn't thought of.

You will feel light and inspired when you're done writing one or two pages in your journal. It'll be as if you had been able to empty your mind - starting the day with a clear, decluttered space.

If you've never journaled, you may wonder what you're supposed to write about. Write anything and let your hand lead the way. That's the magic of journaling. You don't have to start in a particular place for the exercise to be productive. Just write and see where you end up, a page or two later.

Your best thoughts happen in the morning, pre-input. So, journal before you talk to someone, check your phone, or turn on your computer. Brush your teeth, then get journaling.
